Create two pages:
'/' - home page
'/profile' – profile page
1) On the main page, you need to enter the login and password
login – developer21, password – 123456,
if the login / password is entered correctly, then you can click on the "log in" button (if not, it is disabled)
2) after clicking on the "login" button, the user should be redirected to the profile page,
where the login should be displayed in the h1 tag.
To store/display the login, you need to use redux
For routing - react-router
